# Week #3:

###### Previous Week:
- Narrowed map features based on feedback from other teams during Scrum
- Met with studio advisor during the week
- Jumped out of "map" and designed notification-pushing  frame after feedback from studio advisor
- Performed background research to help determine the incentive of Amazon Flex and find our target market
- Made and presented a wire-frame demo during the sprint
- Updated system diagram and narrative

###### Next Week:
- Sign CSP with Amazon
- Review feedback from other groups during presentation to improve our products
- Attend the second meeting with company stakeholders
- Try to get more data for one specific feature

###### Potential Risk:
- CSP assignment
- Product scope undefined
- Focus on more realistic product based on what we already have
